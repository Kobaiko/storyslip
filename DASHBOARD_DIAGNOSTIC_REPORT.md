## üîç Potential Issues to Investigate

### 1. Missing Supabase Configuration
The dashboard uses Supabase but may have configuration issues:

**Check these files:**
- `packages/dashboard/src/lib/supabase.ts` - Supabase client setup
- Environment variables for Supabase URL and keys

### 2. API Client Configuration
The dashboard imports `apiClient` but may have connection issues:

**Check these files:**
- `packages/dashboard/src/lib/api.ts` - API client configuration
- Backend API server running on correct port

### 3. Authentication Flow Issues
Several auth-related components that might have issues:

**Potential Problems:**
- Supabase auth not properly configured
- Session management not working
- Protected routes not functioning
- User context not loading properly

### 4. Missing Environment Variables
The dashboard likely needs these environment variables:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### 5. Build/Development Server Issues
Common development issues:

**Check:**
- Is the development server running? (`npm run dev`)
- Are there any console errors in the browser?
- Is the API server running on the expected port?
- Are all dependencies installed? (`npm install`)

## üöÄ Recommended Next Steps

### Step 1: Check Environment Setup
```bash
# In packages/dashboard directory
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Verify API Connection
Check if the backend API is running:
```bash
# In packages/api directory
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Check Browser Console
Open browser dev tools and look for:
- Network errors (failed API calls)
- JavaScript errors
- Missing resources (404s)

### Step 4: Test Authentication Flow
Try to:
1. Register a new account
2. Login with existing account
3. Access protected dashboard routes

## üîß Quick Fixes to Try

### Fix 1: Clear Browser Cache
```bash
# Clear browser cache and localStorage
# Or use incognito/private browsing mode
```

### Fix 2: Restart Development Servers
```bash
# Kill all node processes and restart
pkill -f node
cd packages/api && npm run dev &
cd packages/dashboard && npm run dev &
```

### Fix 3: Check Database Connection
If using Supabase, verify:
- Project is active
