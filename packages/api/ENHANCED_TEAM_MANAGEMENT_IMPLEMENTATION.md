## Database Schema

### New Tables

#### team_member_onboarding
```sql
CREATE TABLE team_member_onboarding (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  website_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES websites(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  checklist_items JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  completed_items JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  completion_percentage INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  started_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  
  UNIQUE(website_id, user_id)
);
```

#### team_notifications
```sql
CREATE TABLE team_notifications (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  website_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES websites(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  message TEXT,
  data JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
