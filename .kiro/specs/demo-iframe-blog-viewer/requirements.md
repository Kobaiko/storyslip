# Demo Iframe Blog Viewer Requirements

## Introduction

This feature will implement an iframe-based blog post viewer that displays blog posts directly within the demo section of the marketing website. When users click on demo blog posts, instead of opening new tabs or showing modals, the content will be displayed in an iframe that replaces or overlays the current demo content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Iframe Blog Post Display

**User Story:** As a visitor viewing the demo section, I want to click on blog posts and see them displayed inline within the demo area, so that I can read the content without leaving the demo context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on any blog post in the demo widget THEN the blog post SHALL be displayed in an iframe within the demo section
2. WHEN the iframe loads THEN it SHALL display the full blog post content with proper styling and layout
3. WHEN the iframe is displayed THEN it SHALL maintain the demo section's visual context and branding
4. WHEN the iframe content loads THEN it SHALL be responsive and work on all device sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)

### Requirement 2: Iframe Integration and Navigation

**User Story:** As a visitor viewing a blog post in the iframe, I want to easily navigate back to the demo and have smooth transitions, so that the experience feels integrated and seamless.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the iframe is displayed THEN there SHALL be a clear "Back to Demo" button or close mechanism
2. WHEN the user clicks the back/close button THEN the iframe SHALL close and return to the original demo view
3. WHEN transitioning between demo and iframe views THEN there SHALL be smooth animations or transitions
4. WHEN the iframe is open THEN the demo controls (theme/layout selectors) SHALL remain accessible or be temporarily hidden appropriately

### Requirement 3: Iframe Content Loading and Performance

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the blog posts to load quickly in the iframe and display properly, so that I have a smooth reading experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a blog post is requested THEN the iframe SHALL load the content within 2 seconds
2. WHEN the iframe is loading THEN there SHALL be a loading indicator or skeleton screen
3. WHEN the iframe content fails to load THEN there SHALL be an appropriate error message with retry option
4. WHEN the iframe displays content THEN it SHALL properly handle different content lengths and layouts
5. WHEN the iframe is displayed THEN it SHALL not interfere with the parent page's scrolling or layout

### Requirement 4: Demo Widget Click Handling

**User Story:** As a visitor interacting with the demo widget, I want all blog post links to open in the iframe instead of navigating away, so that I stay within the demo experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any blog post card, list item, or large card is clicked THEN it SHALL open in the iframe viewer
2. WHEN the click handler is triggered THEN it SHALL prevent default link navigation behavior
3. WHEN multiple blog posts are available THEN each SHALL have the correct iframe URL mapping
4. WHEN the iframe is already open THEN clicking another blog post SHALL replace the current iframe content

### Requirement 5: Responsive Iframe Design

**User Story:** As a visitor using different devices, I want the iframe blog viewer to work well on my device size, so that I can read comfortably regardless of screen size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewed on desktop THEN the iframe SHALL take up an appropriate portion of the demo section
2. WHEN viewed on tablet THEN the iframe SHALL adjust its size and layout appropriately
3. WHEN viewed on mobile THEN the iframe SHALL be optimized for small screen reading
4. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the iframe SHALL adapt to the new dimensions
5. WHEN the iframe is displayed THEN it SHALL maintain proper aspect ratios and readability

### Requirement 6: Iframe Security and Isolation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the iframe implementation to be secure and not interfere with the main page functionality, so that the site remains stable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the iframe is implemented THEN it SHALL use appropriate sandbox attributes for security
2. WHEN the iframe loads content THEN it SHALL be properly isolated from the parent page
3. WHEN the iframe is displayed THEN it SHALL not allow unauthorized access to parent page data
4. WHEN the iframe content is loaded THEN it SHALL handle cross-origin policies correctly
5. WHEN the iframe is closed THEN it SHALL properly clean up resources and event listeners
