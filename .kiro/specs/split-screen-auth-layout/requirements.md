# Split-Screen Authentication Layout Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to create a modern, professional split-screen authentication layout for the StorySlip dashboard. The design will feature a product preview/demo on the left side and the authentication forms (signup, login, forgot password) on the right side, similar to modern SaaS applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Split-Screen Layout Structure

**User Story:** As a user visiting the authentication pages, I want to see a visually appealing split-screen layout with product information on the left and the form on the right, so that I understand the value proposition while signing up.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any authentication page THEN the layout SHALL display a 50/50 split on desktop screens (≥1024px)
2. WHEN a user visits authentication pages on tablet devices THEN the layout SHALL stack vertically with product preview on top
3. WHEN a user visits authentication pages on mobile devices THEN only the form SHALL be visible with minimal branding
4. WHEN the split-screen layout is displayed THEN both sides SHALL have equal height and proper responsive behavior

### Requirement 2: Product Preview Section

**User Story:** As a potential user, I want to see an engaging preview of the StorySlip dashboard or product features on the left side, so that I understand what I'm signing up for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the product preview section is displayed THEN it SHALL show a screenshot or mockup of the StorySlip dashboard
2. WHEN the preview section loads THEN it SHALL include the StorySlip branding and value proposition
3. WHEN users view the preview section THEN it SHALL display key features or benefits as overlay text
4. WHEN the preview is shown THEN it SHALL have a subtle gradient or overlay to ensure text readability

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Authentication Form Design

**User Story:** As a user filling out authentication forms, I want a clean, spacious form design that's easy to complete, so that the signup process feels professional and trustworthy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication forms are displayed THEN input fields SHALL be wider and more spacious than current implementation
2. WHEN forms are shown THEN they SHALL be centered in the right panel with appropriate padding
3. WHEN users interact with forms THEN all fields SHALL have consistent styling and proper focus states
4. WHEN forms include validation THEN error messages SHALL be clearly displayed with appropriate styling

### Requirement 4: Responsive Behavior and Mobile Experience

**User Story:** As a user accessing authentication pages on different devices, I want the layout to adapt appropriately to my screen size, so that I can easily complete authentication regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop (≥1024px) THEN the split-screen layout SHALL be maintained with 50/50 proportions
2. WHEN viewing on tablet (768px-1023px) THEN the layout SHALL stack vertically with preview on top and form below
3. WHEN viewing on mobile (<768px) THEN only the authentication form SHALL be visible with minimal product branding
4. WHEN transitioning between screen sizes THEN the layout SHALL adapt smoothly without breaking

### Requirement 5: Supabase Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication process to work seamlessly with Supabase, so that I can securely create an account and access the dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users submit the registration form THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing Supabase authentication system
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN users SHALL be redirected to the appropriate dashboard page
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed to the user
4. WHEN users navigate between auth pages THEN the Supabase session state SHALL be properly managed

### Requirement 6: Branding and Visual Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want the authentication pages to reflect the StorySlip brand and feel consistent with the overall application design, so that the experience feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication pages load THEN they SHALL use consistent colors, fonts, and styling with the main dashboard
2. WHEN the StorySlip logo is displayed THEN it SHALL be prominently featured and properly sized
3. WHEN users see the product preview THEN it SHALL accurately represent the current dashboard design
4. WHEN forms are displayed THEN they SHALL follow the established design system and component patterns
