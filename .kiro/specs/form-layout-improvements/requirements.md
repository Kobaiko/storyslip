# Form Layout Improvements Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the need to improve the layout and usability of form input fields across the StorySlip dashboard, particularly focusing on making input fields wider and more visually appealing for better user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Wider Input Fields

**User Story:** As a user filling out forms in the dashboard, I want input fields to be wider and more spacious, so that I can easily see and edit my input without feeling constrained by small field sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views any form in the dashboard THEN input fields SHALL be at least 400px wide on desktop screens
2. WHEN a user views forms on tablet devices THEN input fields SHALL take up at least 80% of the available container width
3. WHEN a user views forms on mobile devices THEN input fields SHALL take up 100% of the available container width with appropriate padding
4. WHEN input fields are displayed THEN they SHALL have consistent sizing across all forms in the application

### Requirement 2: Improved Form Layout Structure

**User Story:** As a user interacting with forms, I want a well-structured layout that makes efficient use of screen space, so that forms are easy to scan and complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN forms have multiple fields THEN related fields SHALL be grouped logically with appropriate spacing
2. WHEN forms are displayed on wide screens THEN multi-column layouts SHALL be used where appropriate to reduce vertical scrolling
3. WHEN forms contain long field lists THEN they SHALL use a two-column layout on screens wider than 768px
4. WHEN forms are displayed THEN there SHALL be consistent spacing between form elements (16px minimum)

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Visual Design

**User Story:** As a user, I want form inputs to have a modern, professional appearance that matches the overall dashboard design, so that the interface feels cohesive and polished.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN input fields are focused THEN they SHALL show a clear focus state with appropriate color and border styling
3. WHEN input fields have labels THEN labels SHALL be properly aligned and have adequate spacing from the input
4. WHEN forms include validation messages THEN they SHALL be clearly visible and appropriately styled

### Requirement 4: Responsive Behavior

**User Story:** As a user accessing the dashboard on different devices, I want forms to adapt appropriately to my screen size, so that I can easily interact with them regardless of my device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing forms on screens larger than 1024px THEN forms SHALL use a maximum width container with centered alignment
2. WHEN viewing forms on screens between 768px and 1024px THEN forms SHALL adapt to use available space efficiently
3. WHEN viewing forms on screens smaller than 768px THEN forms SHALL stack vertically with full-width inputs
4. WHEN form layouts change based on screen size THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and maintain usability

### Requirement 5: Accessibility Improvements

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want forms to be easily navigable and usable with assistive technologies, so that I can complete tasks without barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating forms with keyboard THEN tab order SHALL be logical and intuitive
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN form labels SHALL be properly associated with their inputs
3. WHEN input fields have focus THEN focus indicators SHALL meet WCAG contrast requirements
